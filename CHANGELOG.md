# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — the deck tells itself, and becomes a video

- **Narration** (`storydeck/narration`): what each click says, from its speaker notes — `narrationText` (an
  acronym stays as written; only the words a voice misreads as a word are spelled, `SPELL`: UI, API; numbers as
  words; `[draft]` bridge lines), `sentences`, `captionCues` → `toSrt` / `toVtt`, `chapterList` (YouTube's rules
  checked).
- **Voice** (`storydeck/voice`, Node): a clip per click, cached by what it says — editing one note re-voices that
  click alone. The voice is a port; `chatterboxKit` is the adapter for a local voice kit. `embedClips` carries
  the clips in a single-file page.
- **Narration in the page** (`storydeck/narration-html`, `storydeck/narration.css`): notes (N), a presenter
  window (P) and listen mode (L) — the deck plays itself in the speaker's voice or the browser's, with captions.
- **Video** (`storydeck/video`, Node + ffmpeg): `renderVideo` — every click made forward, its animations stepped
  frame by frame, held for its clip; captions, chapters, a thumbnail and a timeline beside the video. The browser
  is a port; `deckStageDriver` drives `<deck-stage>` with Playwright.
- **`storydeck/deck-stage.js`**: the slide runtime Watch plays on, now in the package.
- **An agent skill** ships in the package: `plugin/skills/storydeck/SKILL.md`.
- **The package holds the library only**: no tests, no demo-site files (0.1.0 carried both).

## 0.1.0 — one source, many lenses

The first version on npm. Read · Scroll · Watch from one source (`PostView`, `BlogView`, `ScrollyView`,
`SlideDeck`), additive builds in `<deck-stage>`, a live figure in Scroll, mobile Watch in full screen, and
**focus** (`storydeck/focus`, `storydeck/focus-html`, `storydeck/focus.css`): per click, what the click is about and
what happens to the rest — looks `grey` · `hide` · `keep`, movers `zoom` · `left` · `right` · `up` · `down` ·
`place`, overlay `blur`; only a forward click animates.
